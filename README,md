# Weather Forecast Application

## Description:
This Python script retrieves the 5-day weather forecast for a given location using the OpenWeatherMap API. It prompts the user to enter either a zip code or a city name and their preferred temperature unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit), and then displays the weather forecast.

## Usage:
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Obtain an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) by signing up for a free account.
3. Once you have obtained the API key, paste it into a new file named `api_key.txt` in the project directory. Make sure the API key is the only content in the file and there are no leading or trailing spaces.
4. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
5. Run the script `GetWeatherForecast.py`.
6. Follow the instructions prompted to enter the location and temperature unit.
